\section{\Large{Introduction}}
\subsection{\Large{Description}}
\Large{The primary functionality of TVM (Ticket Vending Machine) is to accept request from the user and to print out a ticket\cite{fernandes2016requirements}. Taking inspiration from the current version of the TVM that has been implemented by STM, in our TVM we decided to give options for purchasing a ticket in five different possibilities. One trip ticket, Two trip Ticket, One day pass, Weekly Pass and Monthly Pass. At the end of our project, our main goal is to develop functional software which offers functionalities similar to the Montreal metro TVM\cite{kulak2012use}. Our secondary goal is to propose upgradation(if any) upon the functional or non-functional requirements implementation of Montreal metro TVM.}
\subsection{\Large{Why we chose this Project?}}
At the inception, the Montreal metro-line only covered 26 stations with 3 lines\cite{chan2013station}. But today, it connects 68 stations with five different lines. The number of stations has been more than doubled. They added these stations without affecting the established stations. In accordance with the physical changes in the metro lines, there needs to add more requirements in the ticketing software. In other words ticketing software has also evolved with the Montreal Metro transportation system. In this way, TVM ticketing software, had mimicked the software development evolution life-cycle. As the software evolves with time, there needs to be taken care of the current requirements and adding more without affecting the functionalities of the current version. One of the best approach which can define this process is the ’Iterative Software Development Model’. Planning, Requirements gathering, Design,  Implementation, Testing and Evaluation are the important stages in this development model. These stages not only correlates to the software system but also it applies similarly to the growth pattern of Metro in physical world.\par
Moreover, looking at the complexity and the scale of the project, it would be interesting to analyze all the functional, nonfunctional requirements and design TVM Software\citep{alexander2009discovering}.
\subsection{\Large{The Future}}
From the past, what we can predict is that with the economic growth of Montreal, there will be more stations to be added in upcoming years. Keeping these modifications in mind, we will try to design the TVM software which will be easy to maintain as well as easy to add new requirements\cite{laplante2017requirements}.

            \item {\Large\bfseries Past usage } : No need of using the TVM previously since the machine displays all the commands to be followed by the user.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Language} : User should be able to read either English/French.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Skills} : User can use the machine even though; he does not have command on computer language.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Mental/Physical capabilities} : A person should be mentally stable and should be able to use his/her hand. But a blind person can use the TVM with the help of braille script on the keys.

        \end{itemize}
        \vspace{1cm}
    \item {\Large\bfseries User Task}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\Large\bfseries Criticality of Task} : The process is followed in steps one followed by another so that it becomes easier for the user. In addition, there should be clarity about the task.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Task-Specific Goals} : Firstly, accept the money from the user in the form of cash or card payment then ticket is generated after the card is recharged.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Dependency} : Connections at the backend with the network in order to process the bank transactions, power connection and the paper to print the details of the payment.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Usage Time} : User can buy a ticket from 5:30am to 11pm according to the stm rules. Exclusion of standing in the line a user requires two minutes for the complete successful process.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Risks} : There are few risks involved like entering the wrong details of the card by user, during payment by the bank.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\Large\bfseries User Activities}
        \begin{itemize}
                \item {\Large\bfseries Constraints} : User must be more than 4 feet in order to use the TVM and he/she needs to tilt the screen in order to use it sitting in the wheelchair.

            \item {\Large\bfseries Time-zone} : TVM follows eastern time zone since it is installed in Montreal.
            \item {\Large\bfseries Location} : TVM should be placed in a bigger space so that there won’t be any problem even though people stand in queue. In addition, it should be placed at the entrance.
        \end{itemize}
    \item {\Large\bfseries Issues due to Nature}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item {\Large\bfseries Light} : TVM screen adjust the screen even when it is dark.

\label{Use Case Diagram:do}
\end{figure}

Use case model involves mainly two actors namely Commuter and Ticket Vending Machine. Com    muter use cases involve selection of language, purchasing of ticket, recharging of card, make payment for ticket/card. Whereas, TVM takes care of the displaying types of tickets, internal connection to the bank. Apart from these actors, there are two more actors namely Bank which takes care of the payment transactions and a negative use case actor, Hacker who hacks the system and steals the user data.

In the above given activity diagram, Commuter is the one who will start the activity. After the session has been started, he/she will request for the trip information from the TVM on the screen, it will show different options in which a user can purchase a ticket. For our scenario, he/she will be shown five different options. According to the needs of the commuter, he/she will choose the option. Based on the selection, TVM calculates the amount to be paid. It will then after shows different options using which a commuter can pay for the ticket. If he/she pays by cash, he will get back the change.
